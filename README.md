This is a side project I started to get a better understanding of Compose. In the past, I have been
bogged down by perfection. I wanted everything to be perfect. Perfect architecture, perfect code
etc. That caused delays in my project and eventually I lost interest. With this one, my thinking was
to start as simple as possible. And worry about perfection at the end once I build all the UIs and
functionality
